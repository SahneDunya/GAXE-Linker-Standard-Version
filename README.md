# GAXE (Sahne Karnal default executable file)
Gaxe is the standard executable file of Sahne Karnal architecture developed by Sahne Dünya. Gaxe format was developed for Sahne Karnal, an independent operating system project developed by Sahne Dünya, and this format, which is compatible with multiple operating systems thanks to being a 64-bit ELF derivative, is both open source and published under a free license. Gaxe Linker is a Linker created for this executable file. This linker is specifically designed for the Sahne Karnal Compiler compiler. If you ask why the Gaxe format is ELF-based, the Sahne Karnal independent operating system project is known for its efforts to be fully compatible with Unix, although it is not Unix-based. So it is normal that this format is based on this, but Sahne Karnal is not really a Unix! Detailed information about the Sahne Karnal Compiler compiler is described on another page, go there!
